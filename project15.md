# Project 15

## AWS Cloud solution for 2 Company Websites Using a Reverse Proxy Technology 
Summary: This project is aimed at building two websites for a company called Vecna Dynamics (ðŸ˜‰). One of the websites would be the main production website and the other would be a tooling website for their devops team. 
1 VPC was created for the project

8 subnets were created from the VPC for each tier of the architecture

An internet gateway was created for the VPC

Then a route table was created, added to the two public subnets along with routes to all networks 0.0.0.0/0 to enable routing of traffic between that subnet and the internet.

! A NAT gateway was created and given an elastic ip address for the public subnet to enable resources on the private subnet communicate externally with the internet without the possibility of external resources communicating with the resources.
Note: NAT gateways are expensive so for this scenario only one was deployed to save cost.

Another route table was created for the proxy subnet and the business subnet because they contain resource that would need to pull data using the internet through the nat gateway. This route table will be responsible for routing traffic from the proxy subnets in both availability zones to the internet through the NAT gateway.

The public network requires some level of protection to control who or what has access to the resources placed on that subnet. So a security group was created and attached to the public security group.

Another security group was created for the Application Load Balancer to control inbound traffic to the subnet to just HTTP and HTTPS traffic. And outbound traffic set to all.

A target group was created to manage the distribution of traffic between instances in the auto-scaling group

An application load balancer was created to route between distribute the traffic between targets in the target group.

The next resource that was created was the launch template for the autoscaling group.

The launched template was selected to create used at the creation of the autoscaling group. The external load balancer was added to the ASG
